# 🎯 Resume Here - AdMob Debugging Session

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-04
**Status:** Ready for rebuild and testing

---

## 📋 What Was Done

### ✅ Completed
1. **Fixed coin balance refresh bug** - Added missing `refreshUserProfile` call
2. **Fixed ad unit ID bug** - Removed `__DEV__` check that caused placeholder ID in production
3. **Added comprehensive logging** to track down the exact issue:
   - Initialization logging (RewardedAd type checking, instance creation)
   - Ad loading event logging (LOADED vs FAILED_TO_LOAD with triple emoji markers)
   - Runtime check logging (5 individual checks in showRewardedAd)

### 🔍 Current Problem
Despite all configuration being correct (all flags show YES ✅), real Google test ads are NOT showing in EAS builds. Still using simulated ads (2-second delay).

---

## 💡 Leading Theory

**The ad is not loading properly.** The ad instance gets created, but `rewardedAd.load()` either:
- Never completes (stuck loading)
- Fails silently
- Takes too long (user clicks before it finishes)

Result: `isAdLoaded` stays `false` → Check 5 fails → falls back to simulated ads

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (When You Return)

### Step 1: Rebuild with New Logging
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### Step 2: Install APK and Check Logs

**Right After Login (Most Important!):**
Look in console for one of these:
- ✅✅✅ `Real test ad LOADED and ready!` → Ad loaded successfully!
- ❌❌❌ `Test ad FAILED to load!` → Shows error code/message
- **Neither appears?** → Ad is stuck loading (root cause found!)

**When Clicking "Test Ad Loading":**
See which check fails:
- `❌ SIMULATED: Not standalone environment` → Environment detection broken
- `❌ SIMULATED: AdMob not available` → Module import issue
- `❌ SIMULATED: RewardedAd class not loaded` → Class not imported
- `❌ ERROR: rewardedAd instance not created` → Instance creation failed
- `❌ ERROR: Ad not loaded yet` → **Most likely - ad still loading or failed to load**
- `✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED - SHOWING REAL AD NOW!` → Should show real video ad

### Step 3: Report Back

Share:
1. Whether you saw `✅✅✅ LOADED` or `❌❌❌ FAILED` after login
2. Which specific check failed when clicking "Test Ad Loading"
3. Any error codes/messages that appeared

## 📁 Files Modified in This Session

- **src/services/adService.js** - Added extensive logging throughout
- **ADMOB_DEBUG_STATUS.md** - Updated with theories and debugging steps
- **This file (RESUME_HERE.md)** - Quick resume guide

## 📊 Configuration Summary

All correct:
- ✅ Environment: `bare` (standalone build)
- ✅ AdMob module: Loaded
- ✅ RewardedAd class: Available
- ✅ Ad instance: Created
- ✅ Ad Unit ID: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917` (Google test ID)
- ❓ Ad loaded: **This is likely where it's failing**

---

## 🎓 What We Learned

1. `__DEV__` is `false` in production builds (was causing placeholder ad ID)
2. All diagnostic flags can show YES but ads still don't work if loading fails
3. Need to distinguish between "ad instance created" vs "ad loaded and ready"
