## 🎓 Development Notes

### Helper System Architecture
```
User plays quiz → QuizGameScreen awards 2 EXP per correct answer
                → helperService.addHelperEXP() updates Firestore
                → Check if level up (100 EXP per level)
                → Update helper level and reset EXP counter

User views helpers → HelperUpgradeScreen loads all 20 helpers
                   → Shows locked (with cost) and unlocked (with level/EXP)
                   → Can unlock with coins
                   → Can buy EXP with coins (10:1 ratio)

Ratings calculation → Linear interpolation
                    → current = base + (potential - base) × (level - 1) / 9
                    → Example: base 60, potential 90, level 5
                    → current = 60 + (90 - 60) × 4/9 = 73
```

### CSV Import Format
- Download CSV from QuestionManagerScreen
- Add new questions in spreadsheet
- Import CSV back into app
- Admin authorization required
