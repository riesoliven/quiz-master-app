/**
 * Ad Service - Simulated for Expo Go Development
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This is a simulated version for development in Expo Go.
 * Real AdMob integration requires building a custom dev client or production build.
 *
 * To enable real ads:
 * 1. Run: npx expo install expo-dev-client react-native-google-mobile-ads
 * 2. Run: npx expo prebuild
 * 3. Build custom dev client: npx expo run:android or npx expo run:ios
 * 4. Replace this file with real AdMob implementation
