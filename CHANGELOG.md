## October 4, 2025 - AdMob Real Test Ads Implementation

### 🐛 Issues Resolved

**AdMob Integration Bug Fixes:**
- ❌ **Problem:** Real Google test ads not showing in EAS builds - app was falling back to 2-second simulated ads
- ✅ **Root Cause:** Incorrect event listener API usage
  - Was using wrong event type names (`FAILED_TO_LOAD`, lowercase strings like `'rewarded'`, `'closed'`)
  - Caused error: `RewardedAd.addAdEventListener(*) 'type' expected a valid event type value`
- ✅ **Solution:** Updated to correct event types from official `react-native-google-mobile-ads` API:
  - Initialization: `RewardedAdEventType.LOADED` and `AdEventType.ERROR`
  - Showing ads: `RewardedAdEventType.EARNED_REWARD` and `AdEventType.CLOSED`
  - Properly imported `AdEventType` from AdMob module

**Previous Fixes (Earlier in Session):**
- Fixed coin balance refresh bug - added missing `refreshUserProfile` call
- Fixed ad unit ID bug - removed `__DEV__` check that caused placeholder ID in production builds

### ✨ Features Added

**Debug Tools:**

- Real-time ad event monitoring
- On-screen diagnostic information showing:
  - Environment detection (bare/standalone/Expo Go)
  - AdMob module status
  - Ad loading state

### 🐛 Issues Fixed (Later in Session)

**High Score Message Bug:**
- ✅ **Problem:** Messages not appearing on leaderboard when users achieved high scores
- ✅ **Root Cause:** `updateHighScore()` checked `if (newScore > currentHighScore)` which rejected updates when trying to save a message for the same score
- ✅ **Solution:** Changed condition to `if (newScore >= currentHighScore)` to allow message updates

**Perfect Score Display Bug:**
- ✅ **Problem:** Quiz showing 13/14 correct answers even when all 14 answers were correct
- ✅ **Root Cause:** React's async state updates caused race condition - `setQuestionResults()` and `setCorrectAnswers()` hadn't completed before `handleQuizComplete()` read the values
- ✅ **Solution:** Added refs (`questionResultsRef` and `correctAnswersRef`) that update synchronously, ensuring accurate counts when quiz completes
- ✅ **Impact:** Both normal completion and time-up scenarios now track all 14 questions correctly

### 🎯 Current Status

✅ Helper system fully functional
✅ 12 subjects with questions
✅ Multi-currency economy (Energy, Gems, Coins)
✅ CSV import/export working
✅ Leaderboard with messages working correctly
✅ Stats tracking by subject
✅ Perfect score tracking fixed
✅ All quiz completion edge cases handled

## October 5, 2025 (Later Session) - Critical Bug Fixes

### 🔧 Bug Fixes

**1. Leaderboard Message Display**
- **Issue:** User messages weren't appearing on leaderboard after achieving high scores
- **Root Cause:** In `leaderboardService.js`, the `updateHighScore()` function used strict greater-than comparison (`newScore > currentHighScore`), which prevented updating when the score was equal
- **Scenario:**
  1. First call saves score with empty message
  2. Second call tries to update with user's message but same score
  3. Condition `1500 > 1500` = false, so update rejected
- **Fix:** Changed to `newScore >= currentHighScore` to allow updates with same score
- **File:** `src/services/leaderboardService.js:112`

**2. Perfect Score Not Displaying Correctly**
- **Issue:** Quiz showing 13/14 or 12/14 even when user answered all questions correctly
- **Root Cause:** React state batching caused race condition in `QuizGameScreen.js`
  - When answering question 14, `setQuestionResults()` and `setCorrectAnswers()` were called
  - Immediately after, `moveToNext()` → `handleQuizComplete()` executed
  - `handleQuizComplete()` read state values before React processed the updates
  - Result: `questionResults.length = 13` and `correctAnswers = 13` instead of 14
- **Fix:**
  - Added `questionResultsRef` (useRef) to track results synchronously
  - Added `correctAnswersRef` (useRef) to track correct answers synchronously
  - Updated both state and ref on each answer
  - `handleQuizComplete()` and `handleTimeUp()` now use ref values for accurate counts
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/screens/QuizGameScreen.js` - Added refs, updated completion handlers

### 📊 Technical Details

**State Update Race Condition:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Bug):
setCorrectAnswers(prev => prev + 1);  // Async, batched by React
setTimeout(() => {
  moveToNext();  // Reads old state value
}, 1500);

// AFTER (Fixed):
correctAnswersRef.current += 1;  // Sync, immediate
setCorrectAnswers(prev => prev + 1);  // Still update state for UI
// Later in handleQuizComplete:
const finalCount = correctAnswersRef.current;  // Always accurate
```

**Debugging Added:**
- Comprehensive console logging in `QuizGameScreen.js`:
  - Answer submission logs (question number, answer indices)
  - Move to next question logs (current position, last question check)
  - Time up logs (questions answered, results tracked)
  - Quiz complete logs (final stats verification)

### 📁 Files Modified

- `src/services/leaderboardService.js` - Fixed >= comparison for message updates
- `src/screens/QuizGameScreen.js` - Added refs for synchronous state tracking, comprehensive logging
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This update

### 🎯 Testing Results

✅ Perfect scores (14/14) now display correctly
✅ All questions tracked in results (questionResults.length = 14)
✅ Correct answers counted accurately (correctAnswers = 14)
✅ Leaderboard messages appear properly
✅ Works for both normal completion and time-up scenarios

## October 5, 2025 (Evening Session) - NBA 2K-Style Helper Upgrade System

### ✨ Major Features Added

**NBA 2K-Style Manual Rating Upgrade System:**
- Complete overhaul of helper progression system
- Players now manually upgrade individual subject ratings using EXP
- **Exponential cost scaling** (NBA 2K-inspired):
  - 25-49 rating: 5 EXP per +1 point
  - 50-69 rating: 10 EXP per +1 point
  - 70-84 rating: 20 EXP per +1 point
  - 85-94 rating: 50 EXP per +1 point
  - 95-99 rating: 100 EXP per +1 point
- **Base → Potential cap system**: Each helper has minimum (base) and maximum (potential) ratings per subject
- **Batch upgrade planning**: Use +/- buttons to plan multiple upgrades, then "Purchase All" to apply atomically
- **Irreversible upgrades**: No refunds or reallocation after purchase

**New Shop Screen:**
- Dedicated helper shop for purchasing helpers with coins
- Organized by tiers (FREE, COMMON, RARE, EPIC, LEGENDARY)
- Shows all 20 helpers with unlock costs
- Clear "✓ UNLOCKED" badges for FREE helpers
- "✓ OWNED" badges for purchased helpers
- Unlock confirmation dialog with descriptions

**Redesigned Helper Upgrade Screen:**
- Shows ONLY unlocked helpers (empty state with "Go to Shop" button)
- NBA 2K-style batch upgrade interface:
  - +/- buttons to plan upgrades across all 12 subjects
  - Real-time preview: `45 → 48` showing planned changes
  - Dynamic total EXP cost calculation
  - Single "Purchase All Upgrades" button for atomic transactions
  - Planned upgrades reset when switching helpers
- **Buy EXP with Coins**: Enter EXP amount → see coin cost → confirm purchase
- Conversion rate: 10 coins = 1 EXP

**Helper Roster Update - Real Historical Figures:**
- Replaced 8 fictional helpers with real people:
  - **FREE:** Coach Rivera → **Manny Pacquiao** 🥊 (Eight-division world champion)
  - **COMMON:**
    - Dr. Sato → **Stephen Hawking** 🌌 (Physicist)
    - Darwin Jr → **Charles Darwin** 🐢 (Naturalist)
    - Captain Vega → **Neil Armstrong** 👨‍🚀 (Astronaut)
    - Prof. Numbers → **Alan Turing** 🔐 (Codebreaker)
    - Historian Grey → **Cleopatra** 👑 (Pharaoh)
    - Geo Explorer → **Marco Polo** 🧭 (Explorer)
  - **EPIC:** Ada Wong → **Frida Kahlo** 🎨 (Artist)
- Kept 12 real historical figures + 3 personal helpers (Sir Sam, Annie, Snuffles)

### 🔧 Bug Fixes

**EXP Purchase Issues:**
- ✅ **Problem:** Buying EXP with coins didn't deduct coins from balance
- ✅ **Root Cause:** Missing `buyEXPWithCoins` import in `HelperUpgradeScreen.js`
- ✅ **Solution:** Added import and proper two-step purchase flow (deduct coins → add EXP)
- ✅ **Problem:** Loading spinner stuck after purchase
- ✅ **Solution:** Added try-catch-finally block to always reset loading state

**Coin Balance Not Updating:**
- ✅ **Problem:** Coin balance displayed stale value after purchases
- ✅ **Root Cause:** `loadData()` was reading from cached `userProfile.coins` instead of fresh Firestore data
- ✅ **Solution:** Fetch coins directly from Firestore using `getDoc()` in `loadData()`

**UX Improvements:**
- ✅ Reversed EXP purchase flow: Ask for EXP amount → show coin cost (was: ask for coins → show EXP gained)
- ✅ Changed placeholder from "Coins to spend" to "EXP to buy"
- ✅ Conversion display: `Costs: 150 coins` (was: `= 15 EXP`)

### 🎨 Rating System Rebalance

**All 20 helpers rebalanced:**
- Lowered base ratings (no helper starts above 75)
- Created meaningful progression paths to 100
- Highest base ratings now in 60-72 range
- Potential caps range from 48-100 depending on helper expertise
- Makes grinding to 100 rating more rewarding
