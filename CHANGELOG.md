## October 4, 2025 - AdMob Real Test Ads Implementation

### üêõ Issues Resolved

**AdMob Integration Bug Fixes:**
- ‚ùå **Problem:** Real Google test ads not showing in EAS builds - app was falling back to 2-second simulated ads
- ‚úÖ **Root Cause:** Incorrect event listener API usage
  - Was using wrong event type names (`FAILED_TO_LOAD`, lowercase strings like `'rewarded'`, `'closed'`)
  - Caused error: `RewardedAd.addAdEventListener(*) 'type' expected a valid event type value`
- ‚úÖ **Solution:** Updated to correct event types from official `react-native-google-mobile-ads` API:
  - Initialization: `RewardedAdEventType.LOADED` and `AdEventType.ERROR`
  - Showing ads: `RewardedAdEventType.EARNED_REWARD` and `AdEventType.CLOSED`
  - Properly imported `AdEventType` from AdMob module

**Previous Fixes (Earlier in Session):**
- Fixed coin balance refresh bug - added missing `refreshUserProfile` call
- Fixed ad unit ID bug - removed `__DEV__` check that caused placeholder ID in production builds

### ‚ú® Features Added

- Real-time ad event monitoring
- On-screen diagnostic information showing:
  - Environment detection (bare/standalone/Expo Go)
  - AdMob module status
