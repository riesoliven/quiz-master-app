## 👥 **HELPER SYSTEM (DETAILED)**

2. **COMMON (7 helpers)** - Unlock with coins (1,000-3,000 each)
3. **RARE (5 helpers)** - Unlock with coins/gems (5,000 coins OR 50 gems)
4. **EPIC (3 helpers)** - Unlock with gems (150 gems)

---

### **Helper Stats System:**

Each helper has **10 subject ratings** (0-100%):
- Arithmetic & Algebra
- Geometry & Trigonometry
- Statistics & Probability
- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology
- History
- Sports & Entertainment
- Literature
- Astronomy

**Two Rating Types:**
1. **Base Rating** - Current unlocked rating (what helper uses in-game)
2. **Potential Rating** - Maximum rating helper can reach (hidden cap)

**Example:**
```
Einstein (Level 1)
- Physics: 60% base → 98% potential
- Chemistry: 40% base → 75% potential
- Biology: 30% base → 60% potential
```

---

### **Helper Leveling System:**

**EXP Earning:**
- Helper gains EXP when used in a quiz
- EXP earned = Quiz score ÷ 3 (rounded down)
  - 5,000 pts quiz = 1,666 EXP per helper on team
  - 3 helpers on team = each gets 1,666 EXP

**EXP Required per Level:**
- Level 1 → 2: 5,000 EXP
- Level 2 → 3: 10,000 EXP
- Level 3 → 4: 20,000 EXP
- Level 4 → 5: 40,000 EXP
- Level 5 → MAX (10): 80,000 EXP per level

**Leveling unlocks stat upgrades** (purchased separately with EXP)

---

### **Stat Upgrade System:**

When helper levels up, player can **spend EXP to increase base ratings**:

**Cost Formula:**
- EXP cost = (Current Rating - Starting Rating) × 100

**Example (Einstein upgrading Physics):**
- Starting: 60% → 65%: Costs 500 EXP
- 65% → 70%: Costs 1,000 EXP
- 70% → 75%: Costs 1,500 EXP
- 75% → 80%: Costs 2,000 EXP
- ...
- 95% → 98% (max): Costs 3,800 EXP

**Cannot exceed potential rating!**

---

### **Buying EXP with Currency:**

Players can buy EXP to speed up helper progression:

**Coins:**
- 100 coins = 50 EXP
- 1,000 coins = 500 EXP
- 5,000 coins = 2,500 EXP

**Gems:**
- 10 gems = 100 EXP (2× better than coins)
- 50 gems = 500 EXP
- 100 gems = 1,000 EXP

**Strategic choice:**
- Grind quizzes for natural EXP (slow but free)
