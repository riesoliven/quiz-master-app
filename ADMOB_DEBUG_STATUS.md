# AdMob Real Test Ads - Debug Status

## üî¥ CURRENT ISSUE
Real Google test ads are NOT showing in EAS builds - still using simulated ads (2-second delay) instead.

## üîç LEADING THEORY (Updated 2025-10-04)
**The ad is likely not loading.** Even though the ad instance is created successfully, `rewardedAd.load()` might be:
- Stuck loading forever without completing
- Failing silently without triggering error event
- Taking too long (user clicks before LOADED event fires)

This would cause `isAdLoaded` to stay `false`, making Check 5 fail, resulting in simulated ads.

## ‚úÖ WHAT TO CHECK NEXT
After rebuilding and installing the APK:
1. **Login and watch console** - Look for `‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Real test ad LOADED` or `‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå Test ad FAILED to load`
2. **If neither appears** - Ad is stuck loading (root cause identified!)
3. **Click "Test Ad Loading"** - See which specific check fails

## What We Know (From Debug Screen)

### ‚úÖ All Diagnostics Show Correct:
- **Execution Environment:** `bare` (correct for EAS builds)
- **Is Expo Go?:** NO ‚úÖ
- **Is Standalone?:** YES ‚úÖ
- **Expected Ads:** Real Google Test Ads
- **AdMob Status:** Module loaded ‚úÖ
- **Ad Ready?:** YES ‚úÖ
- **isStandalone (internal):** YES ‚úÖ
- **admobAvailable (internal):** YES ‚úÖ
- **hasRewardedAd (internal):** YES ‚úÖ
- **hasInstance (internal):** YES ‚úÖ
- **Ad Unit ID:** `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917` ‚úÖ
- **Test ID (Expected):** `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917` ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå Behavior:
- Clicking "Test Ad Loading" ‚Üí 2 second delay ‚Üí "Ad test completed! Reward: true"
- NO video ad appears
- Still using simulated ads

## What We've Fixed So Far

### 1. Environment Detection (FIXED)
- **Issue:** Was checking `!global.nativeCallSyncHook` (unreliable)
- **Fix:** Now using `Constants.executionEnvironment === 'bare'` or `'standalone'`
- **Result:** Detection works - shows as standalone ‚úÖ

### 2. Ad Unit ID (FIXED)
- **Issue:** Was using `__DEV__` check which is false in EAS builds, so used placeholder `ca-app-pub-XXXXX/XXXXX`
- **Fix:** Changed to always use test ID: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917`
- **Result:** Correct ad unit ID is now being used ‚úÖ

### 3. Test Ad ID (UPDATED)
- **Issue:** Old `TestIds.REWARDED` might be outdated
- **Fix:** Using explicit latest test ID from Google: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917`
- **Result:** Using current Google test rewarded ad ID ‚úÖ

## The Mystery

**All internal flags show YES ‚úÖ, correct ad unit ID is set, but ads are still simulated!**

This suggests the code path is STILL going through the simulated branch at runtime, even though the debug screen shows all checks should pass.

## Latest Changes (Need Testing) - Updated 2025-10-04

### CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Potential Race Condition
**Theory:** AdMob SDK initialization in App.js is async, but `initializeRewardedAd()` is called immediately when MainMenuScreen loads. There might be a race condition where ads are being created before the SDK is fully initialized.

### Added EXTENSIVE Logging to `initializeRewardedAd()`
Added detailed logging around initialization:
- RewardedAd class type checking
- Ad instance creation confirmation
- Event listener setup
- `rewardedAd.load()` call tracking
- LOADED event with triple ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ markers
- FAILED_TO_LOAD event with error details

### Added Granular Logging to `showRewardedAd()`
Changed from combined check to individual checks with logging:

```javascript
// Check 1: Environment
if (!isStandalone) {
  console.log('‚ùå SIMULATED: Not standalone environment');
  setTimeout(() => resolve(true), 2000);
  return;
}

// Check 2: AdMob available
if (!admobAvailable) {
  console.log('‚ùå SIMULATED: AdMob not available');
  setTimeout(() => resolve(true), 2000);
  return;
}

// Check 3: RewardedAd class exists
if (!RewardedAd) {
  console.log('‚ùå SIMULATED: RewardedAd class not loaded');
  setTimeout(() => resolve(true), 2000);
  return;
}

// Check 4: Ad instance created
if (!rewardedAd) {
  console.log('‚ùå ERROR: rewardedAd instance not created');
  reject(new Error('Ad instance not created. Check initialization.'));
  return;
}

// Check 5: Ad loaded
if (!isAdLoaded) {
  console.log('‚ùå ERROR: Ad not loaded yet');
  reject(new Error('Ad not loaded yet. Please wait and try again.'));
  return;
}

// ALL CHECKS PASSED - Show real ad
console.log('‚úÖ ALL CHECKS PASSED - SHOWING REAL AD NOW!');
// ... real ad code ...
```

## Next Steps to Debug

### 1. Rebuild with Latest Logging
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### 2. After Installing APK - Check Console Logs:

**IMMEDIATELY After Login (when MainMenuScreen loads):**
- Look for `üîç initializeRewardedAd called`
- Check if it shows `‚úÖ All checks passed - initializing REAL Google test ads...`
- **MOST CRITICAL:** Look for either:
  - `‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Real test ad LOADED and ready! ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ` (SUCCESS!)
  - `‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå Test ad FAILED to load! ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå` (shows error code/message)
- If neither appears within 5-10 seconds, the ad is stuck loading

**When Clicking "Test Ad Loading":**
1. Check which console message appears:
   - `‚ùå SIMULATED: Not standalone environment` ‚Üí Check 1 failing
   - `‚ùå SIMULATED: AdMob not available` ‚Üí Check 2 failing
   - `‚ùå SIMULATED: RewardedAd class not loaded` ‚Üí Check 3 failing
   - `‚ùå ERROR: rewardedAd instance not created` ‚Üí Check 4 failing
   - `‚ùå ERROR: Ad not loaded yet` ‚Üí Check 5 failing (most likely culprit!)
   - `‚úÖ ALL CHECKS PASSED - SHOWING REAL AD NOW!` ‚Üí Should show real video ad

### 3. View Console Logs
The triple emoji markers (‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ and ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå) make critical events easy to spot in logs.

## Possible Remaining Issues (Ranked by Likelihood)

### Theory 1: Ad Not Loading (MOST LIKELY) üî¥
The ad instance is created but `rewardedAd.load()` either:
- Never completes (stuck loading forever)
- Fails silently without triggering FAILED_TO_LOAD event
- Takes too long and user clicks before LOADED event fires
- **Result:** `isAdLoaded` stays `false`, so Check 5 fails ‚Üí simulated ad

**How to verify:** Look for `‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Real test ad LOADED` in console after login

### Theory 2: Race Condition - SDK Not Initialized
App.js initializes AdMob SDK asynchronously, but `initializeRewardedAd()` is called immediately when MainMenuScreen loads. The SDK might not be ready yet.
- **Result:** Ad creation might fail or use fallback

**How to verify:** Check if AdMob initialization logs appear BEFORE ad initialization logs

### Theory 3: Variable Scope Issue
The variables `isStandalone`, `admobAvailable`, `RewardedAd` might be evaluating differently at:
- **Module load time** (when debug screen reads them) vs
- **Runtime** (when showRewardedAd is called)

### Theory 4: Module Import Issue
`RewardedAd` class might be imported but not fully functional in the build environment.

## Files Modified

### `src/services/adService.js`
- Environment detection using `Constants.executionEnvironment`
- Ad unit ID always uses test ID
- Granular logging for each check
- Exports `getAdDiagnostics()` for debug screen

### `src/screens/DebugScreen.js`
- Shows all internal flags
- Shows ad unit IDs
- Test button with detailed feedback

### `App.js`
- AdMob initialization with environment check
- Added DebugScreen route

### `app.json`
- AdMob plugin configuration
- Test App IDs configured

## Configuration Summary

### Test IDs Currently Used:
- **Android App ID:** `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713`
- **iOS App ID:** `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~1458002511`
- **Rewarded Ad Unit ID:** `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/5224354917`

### Build Profile:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

## When You Resume

1. Install the latest APK build
2. Check Debug screen - verify all still YES ‚úÖ
3. Click "Test Ad Loading"
4. Note which specific check fails (based on console log)
5. Come back with that info and we can fix the exact failing check

## Key Insight Needed

**We need to know WHICH of the 5 checks is failing at runtime**, even though the debug screen shows they should all pass. The new granular logging will reveal this.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-04
**Status:** Debugging why simulated ads still showing despite correct configuration
**Next Action:** Test new build with granular logging to identify failing check
